            <h1>Animal Crossing Villager Guide</h1>
            <p>Change of plans!!!! In the midst of playing around with the Nookipedia API functionality, this project originally started as a fun project to generate a random Animal Crossing: New Horizons villager. But while doing <em>*ahem*</em> research and development on the official Nintendo website for Animal Crossing, a really cool feature on the website is showcasing who's birthday is today!</p>
            <p>Although not the original plan, I really dig how fun and inspiring it was to see which villager's birthday is today and given the rise of astrology in today's world, people seem to be interested in a lot of things related to their date of birth. Alas, you can now see which Animal Crossing neighbor(s)(!) could share the same birthday as you!</p>
